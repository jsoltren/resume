\textbf{Deep Learning Software Engineer}  Nervana / Intel Corp. \hfill Aug 2017 - Feb 2019

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt

\item Driver development for ``Lake Crest". 10 MLOC multithreaded templated C++11.

\item Ran comparisons, benchmarks, and projections for different numerical formats on novel hardware accelerator
      for AI deep learning training, e.g. ResNet.

\item Focus on hardware and software to run GEMM and convolution as fast as possible.

\item Designed an algorithm for all-to-all data transfers on our hardware that beat the Bruck Algorithm,
      the fastest general purpose algorithm.

\item Implemented support for running multiple jobs on a single chip.

\item Consolidated HW initialization and management for increased perf and simpler code.

\end{itemize}
