Who I Am::

I’m a world class computer hardware and system software engineer.
I have a proven track record of successes in personal and professional projects in this domain.
I tend to focus on the backend and on fundamentals, but care deeply about the whole product.
I believe in simplicity, elegance, and beauty at every level of engineering design.
I believe software engineers have much to learn from aeronautical engineers.
I believe in Net Neutrality and a right to privacy, and oppose censorship of non-hateful speech.
I’m a lifelong computer and electronics nerd and taught myself BASIC and circuits at age eight.
I’m Hispanic (Puerto Rican) and a New Yorker.
I’m an alum of Stuyvesant and MIT, in both cases as one of the only Puerto Ricans.
I’m a maker and a tinkerer.
I’m a (student) pilot.
I’m a husband and a father.

What I’ve Done::

I’ve worked on the core of Apache Spark at Cloudera, and have spoken publicly about my work.
I’ve worked on the NVIDIA graphics driver for Linux, and owned the video decoder for a while.
I’ve designed a new type of computer keyboard, shipped them, and sold over 1000.
Along the way, I’ve solved thousands of problems and unblocked countless people.

Everywhere I go, I decrease overhead, and add value and simplicity far above my pay grade.
I leave things cleaner than I found them, whether or not they are mine to clean.

What I Want To Do::

Work on world-class problems with world-class people in a world-class environment.
Continue to grow every day.
Lead by example.
