José Hiram Soltren's résumé.

Based on res.cls, originally by Michael DeCorte.

This is a "quick and dirty" resume implementation in LaTeX. To build, do:

```
$ pdflatex personal-statement.tex
$ pdflatex resume.tex
```

For convenience, recently generated PDFs are included in the repository.

Some nice to have features in the future would be:

* More cleanup. It's lean but could be leaner.
* 79-column compliance.
* Makefile support.
* More detail about previous positions.
* Levels of verbosity, for generating a one page, two page, or very long CV style document.
* Better automatic page flowing - this version uses a hard page break.
* More hyperlinks .
* A headshot.

This will all need to come later! Thanks for reading.
