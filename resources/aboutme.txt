Who I Am::

\begin{itemize}
\item I'm a world class computer hardware and system software engineer.
\item I have a proven track record of successes in personal and professional projects in this domain.
\item I tend to focus on the backend and on fundamentals, but care deeply about the whole product.
\item I believe in simplicity, elegance, and beauty at every level of engineering design.
\item I believe software engineers have much to learn from aeronautical engineers.
\item I believe in Net Neutrality and a right to privacy, and oppose censorship of non-hateful speech.
\item I taught myself BASIC and circuits at age eight (so fun!).
\item I'm Hispanic (Puerto Rican) and a New Yorker.
