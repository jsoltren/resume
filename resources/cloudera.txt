Cloudera, Inc.
Software Engineer, Austin, TX, 2016-2017

Engineering development work on Apache Spark, a distributed computation platform with fault tolerance billed as the successor to MapReduce.

Worked on fault tolerance and reliability in Spark core code by working with colleagues to implement a blacklisting mechanism for faulty compute resources. Delivered a talk about this work at the Spark Summit in Boston, February 2017.

Designed an addition to Apache Spark that would allow compute resources to report on memory utilization in real time.

Worked with several teams to scope work needed to support hardware accelerators as first class citizens at deployment and execution time in Apache Spark.

Worked with QA teams to design, implement, and adopt an internal fault injection framework for endurance and vulnerability testing on Apache Spark.

Fixed bugs and implemented features in Apache Spark.

Worked to fix customer escalations.

Technologies used: Spark, Scala, Java, JVM, Python, Jenkins, git
