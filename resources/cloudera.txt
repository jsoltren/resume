\item Engineering development work on Apache Spark, a distributed computation

      report on memory utilization in real time.

\item Worked with several teams to scope work needed to support hardware
      accelerators as first class citizens at deployment and execution time
      in Apache Spark.

\item Worked with QA teams to design, implement, and adopt an internal fault
      injection framework for endurance and vulnerability testing on Apache Spark.

\item Fixed bugs and implemented features in Apache Spark. Worked on
      customer escalations.
