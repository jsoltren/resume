José Hiram Soltren's résumé.

Based on res.cls, originally by Michael DeCorte.

To build, do:

```
$ make all
```

For convenience, recently generated PDFs are included in the repository.

This is a work in progress. Next up could be:

* More cleanup. It's lean but could be leaner.
* 79-column compliance.
* More detail about some positions, configurable at build time.
* Better automatic page flowing, to get rid of the hard break
  in the NVIDIA section..
* More hyperlinks.
* A headshot.

Thank you for your consideration.
